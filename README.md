# Kettle's House Rules

## Purpose Of This Document:

The purpose of this document is to take note of my unique rules that are above the set of rules given by the Core Rulebook (aka CR). As I read through the CR, I am noting things I would like to do differently here. It forces me to pay close attention to the set of rules set by Paizo in the CR, and become very familiar with the layout of the CR. This allows me to quickly reference a rule while a game is in session. I strongly urge you, reader, to do the same, and create your own rule set while reading along with the CR. However, if you are a Starfinder veteran, please feel free to use these rules at your will. 

And of course, any feedback is greatly appreciated.

#### How To Use These Rules:

The contents are listed in order of the CR, and thus, there may be some sections that don't have any extra rules, and will be empty. Should you choose to incorporate these rules, there will exist a hierarchy of rule-sets. If one does not exist at the top level, step one level down for the rule, and so on, until you hit the CR (ex; If you do not have your own house rule, then reference this set, and if there is no rule here, then follow the core rule book).

#### Disclaimer:

This is a very small subset of rules for the Role-playing Game (RPG) known as Starfinder. This game is owned by Paizo. This subsest of rules, known as "Kettle's House Rules", is not enough to be able to play the game.

### Chapter 1: Character Creation

##### Section 1: Creation Steps

1. Any adjustments to the 9 steps in the CR will be listed here:
    1. Step 2, "Choose a Race"
        1. Refer to Chapter 2, Section 8 of this rule set to understand half-race options. Otherwise choose a race as normal.
    2. Step 3, "Choose a Theme"
        1. Refer to Chapter 1, Section 6 for choosing a theme.
    3. Step 5, "Finalize Ability Scores"
        1. Refer to Chapter 1, Section 2 of this rule set to learn how to apply ability scores.
    4. Step 9, "Fill in the Finishing Details"
        1. Refer to Chapter 1, Section 4 about how to align your character.
        2. If you're playing an Amalgam, please refer to Chapter 2, Section 8, Article 1, Paragraph 7 to find how to asign your characters languages.
        3. If you're playing an Amalgam, please refer to Chapter 2, Section 8, Article 1, Paragraphs 3 and 4 to find limits on the size of your character,


##### Section 2: Ability Scores

1. This rule set will follow the buying of ability scores, wherein, all players start with 10 in each ability, apply racial, class, and theme bonuses, and then spend their 10 points finalizing their character.
2. After 10 points have been spent, before filling in the character sheet; take the 3 worst abilities and assign them a number 1, 2, or 3. Roll a d6. A roll of 1 or 2 applies to ability 1, 3 or 4 to ability 2, and 5 or 6 to ability 3. The ability chosen this way gets -5 to it.

##### Section 3: Health And Resolve

##### Section 4: Alignment

1. Assign the following values to the given alignments:
    1. Lawful Good = 1
    2. Lawful Neutral = 2
    3. Lawful Evil = 3
    4. Neutral Good = 4
    5. Neutral Evil = 5
    6. Chaotic Good = 6
    7. Chaotic Neutral = 7
    8. Chaotic Evil = 8
2. Roll a d8, and assign the alignment to your character.
3. While it may be dangerous to mix Good with Evil in a single party, the party is made up of your comrades with a similar goal. This means you shall not screw over any of your comrades in a way that would cost them their items, or health. Here are one allowed and one disallowed scenario each:
    1. **Allowed**: The battle is finished, there is one survivor who the group has questioned and acquired all information from. The Good and Evil players may have a roll to see to the fate of the prisoner (release or death). 
    2. **Disallowed**: The goal is to acquire attack plans on a city and return them to the city lead. While the group is in battle, the evil player swipes the plans and takes off leaving the others to die.

##### Section 5: Leveling Up

1. Retraining:
    1. With regards to altered memories because of the Mnemonic Editor; With each new rank purchased, the alteration gets worse. Follow the CR for using a Mk 1 Mnemonic Editor. When using a Mk 2, the memories get worse, but the more important memories can still be put together. After using Mk 3, memories are mostly gone where comrades are known, but don't know how they were introduced into ones life. After Mk 4, all memories are lost, and it is on the comrades to try and convince the user of who they are and why they blong to the group.

##### Section 6: Character Themes

1. A player may create a theme, and thus its bonuses, not strictly following the CR custom theme rules. However, it must be approved by the GM to ensure balance.


### Chapter 2: Races

##### Section 1: Android

1. With provided backstory of how this Android came into existence, a player *may* have his or her Android look like any of the biological races (other than human), but he or she may only take on the Android racial benefits.
